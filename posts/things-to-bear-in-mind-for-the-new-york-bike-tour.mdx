The annual New York Bike Tour is an opportunity to parooze all 5 boroughs of New York on your bike safely, and the date, May 7th, 2023 is creeping up.

In 2022, 32,000 people took up the roads and bridges of all five boroughs to pedal about 40 miles. Do not be afraid to take the chance to chat with these like-minded individuals who enjoy cycling in all regards. Take down numbers and social media tags. You just might find your new cycling crew. I know my first year I was shy but in my second year, I came around and made a few friends!

You may be tempted to try artisanal cold brew or share slices at a sit-down with your team. This is certainly doable. Make sure your stop is less than 15 minutes unless you are super fast on your feet or show up before packet pickup to indulge.

> PS. packet pickup lines are usually not that long, so you don't need to worry about hustling to get there extra extra early

In 2022 I made an hour-long pit stop in Green Pointe for coffee and browsed a health food store. Subsequently, I lost track of time and space and wound up needing to take an alternative route because the Verrazano bridge opened back up for the public. I ended up riding through Manhattan on my own to take the ferry back to Staten Island; getting lost multiple times. Very scary to say the least. This New Jersey cyclist is not built for those roads on any given day.

Be careful with your phone. I have watched people fall off their bikes trying to take photos. In my first year, I witnessed a person's phone fall to its demise off the Verrazano Bridge. Serious accidents occur when you don't stop to snap pictures, so make sure to use your kickstand. Stay mindful.

Make sure you are hydrating adequately. According to health professionals, it is suggested women drink 2.7 liters and men drink 3.7 liters per day.

The rest stops provide many snack options, such as bananas, pretzels, and raisins. The snacks vary per year but these are the staple items. I recommend going for a banana since they carry magnesium and potassium which are necessary for optimizing athletic capacity.

Since this is an endurance event make sure you are having 8 to 12 g/kg of carbohydrates per pound of body weight and 1.2 1.4 g/kg of protein per pound of body weight.

Snap on your helmet, be mindful, and be aerodynamic! I hope to see you there.
