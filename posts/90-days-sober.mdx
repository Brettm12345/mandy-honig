Tomorrow I am 90 days stone-cold sober because it got old being hungover. I won't put too much of my story into your brain because this is about progression but for a while, my life looked like doing food deliveries for money only to blow it all on several helpings of long island iced teas at Applebees (I hiss like a feral cat at any Applebees I drive past). On top of that, I misused cannabis. Sad times indeed. I was locked in substance misuse patterns since the ripe age of 18 and lost many years of self-development because of it.

I never gave myself a chance to truly become an adult.

In May, I am growing into the age of 24 and I will be celebrating accordingly: with mocktails and great company. I will be investing my birthday funds into my career instead of blowing it at the newly established dispensary and becoming a patron at the local dive.

Currently, it's a Sunday afternoon; we are in April. I am surrounded by trees at a park with flowers I can't identify on my own. People are running around me and riding their bikes. I am safe and surrounded by healthy people. The only tangible substances in my body are breakfast, water, and a sports drink. I am half smiling with perfect posture. I am grateful.

The word grateful hardly crossed my mind before I began my journey into maintaining a lifestyle where I faced my problems head-on. My moods were all over the place due to my constant manipulation of brain chemistry so I was usually depressed and saw nothing more than the negative.

Since I was on illicit substances all the time, I couldn't maintain the same equilibrium as everyone else. I was simply in another dimension and could not connect with other people.

The friends I made these past 90 days are older, and wiser than me, and also love to hike and work out. They are guiding me along so my recovery is fundamentally foolproof.Â 
So if you're in recovery, get yourself some nature-loving recovery-driven badasses into your corner. Listen to how their day is going and love them.

I feel like I can speak openly now that I have nothing to hide. I am just Mandy. No more digging for what my true self would say while conversing. I wake up and can be unapologetically myself around strangers, although the shyness from holing up for so long is hard to shake out.

Alcohol is inherently bad for the human body and I am proud to be a sober athlete. Here's to 90 days and I will check back in at my 9-month mark!
