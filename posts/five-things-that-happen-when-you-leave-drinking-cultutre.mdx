If you are sober-curious, in desperate need of sobriety, or looking out for somebody who has a drinking problem, this article is for you. As a sober person who attends meetings, I must say this life is worth the work. Here are five things that might happen when you quit drinking.

## Less anxiety

Alcohol interacts with GABAa receptors, which is why some people initially experience a calming effect. However, it ultimately creates an imbalance between the neurotransmitters GABAa and Glutamate. When you begin to leave these receptors alone or activate them through practices such as yoga and mindfulness meditation, your anxiety levels will plummet or even out. This is not to say it happens for everyone, as some of us drink to relieve pre-existing anxiety disorders. But it is to say that alcohol does wreak havoc on neurotransmitters as well as gut health and our endocrine system. Alcohol does nothing good for the body.

## Boredom

Since we have grown accustomed to altering our brain chemistry and associating it with fun, we may grow bored at times. We are used to becoming a whole different person with a completely different train of thought. Take this opportunity to cultivate or revisit new interests, like archery or reading at the library. At the end of the day, it is all about replacing unhealthy habits with healthy ones. This becomes easier, especially after 90 days of dedication to sobriety.

## Sugar cravings

Sugar releases endorphins and triggers dopamine in most individuals. In other words, sugar and alcohol both stimulate the same exact neuropathways. From putting in your dessert or alcohol order to the hand-to-mouth action, there is a lot of similarity between the two. After all, alcohol contains tons of sugar especially if you are a Rum and Cola type of gal or guy. Do not feel ashamed for wanting sugar at the beginning. Have a brownie or two, itâ€™s way healthier.


## Feeling left out

Feelings of isolation are common during early sobriety. Old friendships that are centered around drinking may not make sense anymore. As a 23-year-old it was hard at first to no longer have the social life depicted on Instagram. The nights out to the bars, and wine-soaked shopping voyages, I'll Venmo you for this, and I'll pay for this round since you paid for ours last time.

It's not uncommon that once the alcohol leaves the system, so does the bustling weekend social life you inevitably end up leaving behind when you put down the drink. Instead, you might just end up with a solid group of health-conscious individuals who wake up at 7 am to meet at the farmers market and then go for a stretch at the park.

## Your skin will glow and your eyes will shine

Alcohol is a physical resource sycophant and is good at dehydrating the body. Alcohol makes it harder to properly fuel your body and give your skin what it needs most-water and properly digested meals. Feeling sluggish and puffy-faced the next day after shots with your squad will no longer be an issue.
This does not apply to everyone, however. Some people face hormonal changes after some time sober, resulting in acne. No matter what, you are still beautiful. KEEP SHINING and NEVER GIVE UP!
