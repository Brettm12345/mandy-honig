When difficult emotions arise, it can be tempting to turn to unhealthy behaviors rooted in self-sabotaging instincts. Self-sabotaging behaviors present themselves as self-destructive, unhelpful, and invasive to ourselves and others: lashing out at our loved ones, overconsumption, and/or emotional spending.

If you have turned to any of these behaviors previously, do not be ashamed. We live in a society that perpetuates over-consuming. As for lashing out? It certainly is a behavior in need of overriding. Resorting to projecting onto the person in front of you can be easy in the moment and detrimental long term.

But now it's time to get our hands dirty and find more confidence in our ability to handle things when life gets lifey.

Perhaps at this very moment, you want to slam your only phone onto the concrete, resorting your touch screen to tiny fragments.

Fret not, I'm going to remind you of the basics. Take a glass of water, some deep breaths through your nose, and find a comfy seat. I am no therapist, but I have been through my fair share of life-marking unpleasant experiences and seeking help. These tips apply to whether you've got a parking ticket or are coping with a tremendous loss within your circle.

## Chew gum

That's right. Grab your favorite flavored gum from your local bodega and chew it. This will keep your mouth occupied and away from behaviors you seek to avoid, such as drinking, smoking, or biting your nails. Tune into the sensations; the brisk taste of mint or the spicy flavor of cinnamon.

## Feel all the feels

Where do you feel the tension? In your neck? Your legs? Your heartstrings? Pay attention to the uncomfortable physical sensations. Do not react. Just feel. Perhaps turn this practice into a meditation. At the end of the day, the broad human spectrum of emotions is a beautiful thing, no matter how painful or unfair. You are here and you are happening.

## Listen to music you identify with

There is nothing more cathartic than putting on music by an artist whose emotions you identify with strongly. Make sure you aren't in too deep otherwise this practice can drag you even further. When you are at a 10 it may be best to act the opposite and put on music with a highly positive message. You can also make a playlist, which will keep you occupied and allow for a bit of creativity.

## Solve a puzzle

Use your brain differently and strengthen other neural pathways by solving a puzzle. Tempted to check up on your ex after a breakup? Use your phone more constructively by downloading a crossword app.

## Visit a nature preserve

To me, there is nothing more soothing than a walk or a run through the woods. This is my go-to because I consider my higher power to be nature. Maybe you do as well. Phone a friend and take in the scenery together. If you are alone, turn on your location just in case!

## Costco samples

This may sound silly, but I've gone to Costco when I've felt despondent just for the samples. This will get you out of your house and give room for social interaction. Take in the stimuli and treat it like a mini cocktail hour by grabbing several helpings of free samples.

These are a few ways I've managed to cope with negative emotions and circumstances. I still stand proud today, despite going through hardship and so have you.

Remember, there is no way out of hardship. None of us are initially inured to the trials and tribulations of life. We can only build mastery surrounding our emotions and reactions.
